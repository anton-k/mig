# TODO

Features, improvements and open problems for releases:

## v3

* add capture all case
* add Queries case
* cookbook for main scenarios (add to tutorial)

## v3.2

* make it faster and look out for optimization oportunities

## v4

* HTTP-Streaming
* websockets

## v5

* generate Mig client and server from open-api yaml file. Useful for spec first approach

### ideas

* import client from swagger

   That might be super-useful for sketching API's we can download
   swagger open-api file from API web-page trim it to needed methods
   and provide type signatures for the client

   it will produce run time error if it does not work

   maybe we can generate clients as the next step from open api
